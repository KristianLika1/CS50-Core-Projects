# CS50 Core Projects

This repository contains my completed core projects from Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science.

## Contents
- Week 1: C programs (hello, cash, credit)
- Week 2: Arrays and algorithms
- Week 3: Algorithms (sorting, searching)
- Week 4: Memory and pointers
- Week 5: Data structures
- Week 6: Python scripts
- Week 7: SQL project â€“ Fiftyville
- Homepage: Static website built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
- Movies: SQL queries for IMDb-style database

## Note
I did not complete the final web track modules, as my focus was on data handling and scientific computing.

This repo is a clone of my original one since CS50 keeps them private.
