sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: The best case scenario for bubble sort is an already sorted algorithm, since I already tested for the sort2,
I compared sort1 and sort3 on 50k sorted and the time was much lower for the sort1.

sort2 uses: Merge sort.

How do you know?: Because it has the lowest sorting time of the three in the random order.
That is congruent with the big O notation of n (log n) compared to n^2.

sort3 uses: Linear

How do you know?: TODO
